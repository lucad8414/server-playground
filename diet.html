        Diet plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and fitness.
A balanced diet provides essential nutrients that your body needs to function properly. These include vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Each nutrient has a specific role, such as supporting immune function, building and repairing tissues, and providing energy.
    </p>
    <p>
Eating a healthy diet helps in maintaining a healthy weight. Consuming the right amount of calories and nutrients can prevent weight gain and reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.
    </p>
    <p>
The food you eat directly affects your energy levels. A diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables can keep you energized throughout the day. On the other hand, a diet high in sugar and processed foods can lead to energy crashes and fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
Nutrition also impacts mental health. Diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins can improve brain function and reduce the risk of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. Foods like fish, nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are particularly beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
A healthy diet can prevent chronic diseases. For example, a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can lower blood pressure, reduce cholesterol levels, and improve heart health. Antioxidant-rich foods can also protect against cellular damage and reduce the risk of cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
Proper nutrition is essential for physical fitness. Proteins help in muscle repair and growth, while carbohydrates provide the energy needed for exercise. Staying hydrated and consuming the right nutrients can enhance athletic performance and recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
A balanced diet contributes to a longer, healthier life. Studies have shown that people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins tend to live longer and have a lower risk of chronic diseases.

<h4>
    To help you to keep up with all you're macro- and micronutrients, aswell as calories we develpoded a food-trackig-tool.
</h4>
<p>
    The tool is pretty simple to use. Just put the name of the food or the ingridient in. Add the weight of that food and you're done.
</p>
<p>
    The tool will also tell you important facts about you're food, aswell as the hard numbers. You can just skip the information, but remember the numbers do not implicate health.
    After you put you're entire meal in, you can press the "Done"-button and you will recieve all the nutrients you have eaten, aswell as the remaining for your daily goal
    according to the WHO and in relation to your weight and size.
